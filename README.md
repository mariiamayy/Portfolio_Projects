This project explores patient data using SQL to perform analysis and manage healthcare records. The goal was to extract insights and maintain data integrity through various queries and operations.

Key Highlights:
- Retrieved and filtered patients by age, gender, and medical conditions.
- Calculated metrics like average BMI and age, and ranked patients by blood glucose levels.
- Used subqueries to compare values against averages.
- Updated, inserted, and deleted patient records as needed.
- Created views and applied constraints to improve data structure.
- Suggested schema improvements and basic query optimization techniques.

Skills Used:
SQL · Joins · Aggregation · Subqueries · Data Manipulation · Views · Constraints · Query Optimization

## 🍽️ Restaurant Menu & Orders SQL Project

This project focuses on building and analyzing a restaurant’s menu and order system using SQL. It includes foundational to advanced SQL tasks for database design, data retrieval, and manipulation.

Key Highlights:
- Convert raw datasets into SQL tables (menu_items, order_details)
- Perform queries involving filtering, sorting, joins, subqueries, and aggregations
- Apply date/time functions, conditional logic, and data modifications (UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE)
- Use Window Functions (RANK, LAG, LEAD), CTEs, and dynamic SQL
- Implement stored procedures, triggers, recursive CTEs, and temporal tables
- Practice database transactions, security roles, and indexing for performance

Skills Used:
SQL · Joins · Aggregations · Subqueries · CTEs · Window Functions · Stored Procedures · Triggers · Indexing · Database Security
