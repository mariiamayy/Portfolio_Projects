### 🩺 Patient Health Records SQL Project

This project explores patient data using SQL to perform analysis and manage healthcare records. The goal was to extract insights and maintain data integrity through various queries and operations.

Query 

Key Highlights:
- Retrieved and filtered patients by age, gender, and medical conditions.
- Calculated metrics like average BMI and age, and ranked patients by blood glucose levels.
- Used subqueries to compare values against averages.
- Updated, inserted, and deleted patient records as needed.
- Created views and applied constraints to improve data structure.
- Suggested schema improvements and basic query optimization techniques.

Skills Used:
SQL · Joins · Aggregation · Subqueries · Data Manipulation · Views · Constraints · Query Optimization

### 🍽️ Restaurant Menu & Orders SQL Project

This project focuses on building and analyzing a restaurant’s menu and order system using SQL. It includes foundational to advanced SQL tasks for database design, data retrieval, and manipulation.

Query 

Key Highlights:

- Perform queries involving filtering, sorting, joins, subqueries, and aggregations
- Apply date/time functions, conditional logic, and data modifications (UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE)
- Use Window Functions (RANK, LAG, LEAD), CTEs, and dynamic SQL
- Implement stored procedures, triggers, recursive CTEs, and temporal tables
- Practice database transactions, security roles, and indexing for performance

Skills Used:
SQL · Joins · Aggregations · Subqueries · CTEs · Window Functions · Stored Procedures · Triggers · Indexing · Database Security

### 🖼️ Famous Paintings & Artists SQL Project

This project explores a rich dataset of paintings, artists, museums, and artwork details using SQL. It answers analytical questions ranging from basic lookups to advanced CTEs and window functions.

Query 

Key Highlights:

- Analyze pricing data (e.g., discounts, overpriced items)
- Investigate museum details: hours, open days, locations
- Rank most/least popular painting subjects, canvas sizes, and styles
- Discover top artists and museums by painting count
- Track artwork across countries and link artists to global reach
- Use CTEs, subqueries, and window functions to derive deeper insights

Skills Used:
SQL · Joins · Subqueries · Window Functions · Aggregate Functions · Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

### 📊 Northwind Sales & Customer Behavior SQL Project - Part of my Data Analysis Program with Carerha 

This project explores the Northwind database using SQL to uncover insights related to sales performance, customer segmentation, product trends, order behavior, and employee efficiency. The objective was to support data-driven decision-making by writing targeted SQL queries and compiling a report that presents key findings, actionable insights, and their business implications.

Query

Report

Key Highlights:
- Segmented customers using RFM and Average Order Value analysis.
- Identified top-performing customers, high-value buyers, and at-risk clients.
- Ranked products by revenue and order volume; flagged low-performing items.
- Analyzed seasonal and weekly order patterns, and distribution of order sizes.
- Evaluated employee performance by total sales, order count, and average order value.
- Recommended marketing, inventory, and HR strategies based on insights.
- Summarized results visually and suggested business improvements.

Skills Used:
